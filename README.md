# Snippet-HackTheLib
Snippet allows users to login, and save small snippets of code for future reference.
You can (soon) search for other's snippets and 'snip' (favourite) them, to learn from and reference in the future.

Entering for best design.

Hi judges, I am Connor George, a 15 year old developer from the UK. I have learnt Django and Vue.js. The website is an SPA.

Future:
  Adding tags for snippets (Need to add it to form, back-end for tags is done)
  Community (users can learn off of others by searching code snippets. They can also 'snip', them for future reference. Most snipped snippets will be on featured!)
